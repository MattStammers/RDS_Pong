## RDS Pong

This was a mini experiment to build a pong game in under 30 minutes using chatGPT. The game is intentially quite difficult.

Left player uses W and S to move. Right player uses up and down arrows. First to score 10 points is the winner.

To run the game download the executable and run the .exe file inside the dist/ folder.

Contributions: I used ChatGPT to generate the initial codebase but had to debug it and finish it off myself because the GPT code didn't work on its own. Definitely an interesting new technology that.
