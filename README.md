## RDS Pong

This was a mini experiment to build a pong game in under 30 minutes. The game is intentially quite difficult.

Left player uses W and S to move. Right player uses up and down arrows. First to score 10 points is the winner.

To run the game download the executable and run the .exe file inside the dist/ folder.
